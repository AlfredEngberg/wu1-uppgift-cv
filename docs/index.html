        <p>I am a trained Commissar from the Scholda Progenium. I was noted for my skills with my sword. Ontop of
            that I also have several years of field Experience. I was without any bad behavior during that time.</p>

        <h2 id="Experience">Experience</h2>
        <p>I have spent several years in the field as a commissar. I started my commissar career off by holding off a tyranid splinter fleet and an ork invation at the same time. I managed to hold them off so that I got evacuated. </p>
        <p>During 920.M41 through 923.M41 I was deployed with the vahlhallan 597th regiment on Kathia where I descovered a gene stealer cult and saved the world.</p> 
        <p>During the year of 925.M41 I raised an army behind ork backlinnes on the planet Parilia. There I commanded the army to the Imperial front lines and killed the ork Warboss along the way.</p>  
        <p>The year of 937.M41 I was deployed on Adumbria and I discovered a chaos cult and defeated a deamon prince, and threfor preventing the world from becoming a chaos world. </p> 
        <p>During the year of 938.M41 I found a cure to a zombie virus by having priests bless them before use. I distrabuted the vaccines and destroyed the nurgle cult that was in controll of the zombies.</p>

       
        <h2 id="Skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>Superb sword fightinh skills.</p>
        <p>I am also unable to die according to Imperium law. I was killed in action only to later turn back up alive and well.</p>
        <p>Great with keeping morale of troops at an alltime high.</p>

        <h2 id="Letter">Application Letter</h2>
        <p>Dear Mr. Lord Commander Militant,</p>
        <p>I am writing to you regarding a request for a change in my current duties. As the Lord Commander may know that I am currently stationed as a garrison on the world of Valhalla. I wanted to request a change in my duties. What I am asking for is to be assigned to the local department of the Adeptus Administratum.</p>
        <p>I am asking to get a position with the Administratum as an inventory manager. I feel as if this position suits my skill set well. I have great leadership skills, stress management and being hailed as a hero of the Imperium any true believers of the Emperor would instantly be grateful for the chance to work with me, and considerably boost worker morale.</p>
        <p>It is my belief that I would contribute greatly to the Administratum. I have the perfect 
            attributes for stressful situations and with my years of deployment in the field have taught me what the troops need, where and when. For example during the year of 938.M41 the world I was stationed on had a Nurgle virus outbreak. I saved that world because I discovered that it was in fact warp related and had priests bless the vaccines before they were used, without me being there the world would in most likelihood fall. I led an assault on the zombies and pushed them back out of several cities.</p>
        <p>It is not the only reason to hire me, with the years I spent as a Commissar I have learned that morale of the troopers directly correlates to their effectiveness. The job as a Commissar has put a lot of strain on my body and mind so I do not fear any effects of a stressful work environment. For instance during the year of 919.M41 I fought on the front lines against 2 different xenos, Orks and Tyranids, and what can be more stressful than having your life on the line.
        </p>
        <p>With that being said it would be a grave mistake not to employ me. I have all the experience necessary to do the work with considerable effectiveness and on top of that boost the amount and quality of work by existing workers.
        </p>
        <p>Yours faithfully, Ciaphas Cain</p>
